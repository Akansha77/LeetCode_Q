# 2513. Minimize the Maximum of Two Arrays
[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-maximum-of-two-arrays/)
### We have two arrays arr1 and arr2 which are initially empty. You need to add positive integers to them such that they satisfy all the following conditions:

* arr1 contains uniqueCnt1 distinct positive integers, each of which is not divisible by divisor1.

* arr2 contains uniqueCnt2 distinct positive integers, each of which is not divisible by divisor2.

* No integer is present in both arr1 and arr2.

### Given divisor1, divisor2, uniqueCnt1, and uniqueCnt2, return the minimum possible maximum integer that can be present in either array.

## Constraints:

### 2 <= divisor1, divisor2 <= 105
### 1 <= uniqueCnt1, uniqueCnt2 < 109
### 2 <= uniqueCnt1 + uniqueCnt2 <= 109
